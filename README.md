# Kamikaze
Kamikaze (神風) is a "flight-support" plugin that ensures "reality" of in-flight collision in Minecraft.  

Just like real-life, If you are colliding with blocks with high-speed,  
This will cause explosion, just like [real life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks) and What usually [Kamikaze did in WWII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamikaze).
